# Word2Mp3
This little program converts words individually from a .txt input file to  mp3.


USAGE:
1. Make a file called input.txt and write in it the words that you want to convert to a mp3
2. Put the input.txt and the executable in the same folder and run the executable
NOTE: To convert words that consist of more words use a "-". For example lilly-of-the-valley


You can also compile it on your system :

1.For windows you can use Dev-Cpp and add the curl library (the curl folder)

2.For mac you can just use clang and it should find the provided curl library

3.For linux you should install a package named libcurl and execute the script BuildScriptWithGCC&libcurl or just copy the code from it
